# YaCy Web Search Extension for OpenWebUI

**Supercharge Your LLMs with Web Search Powered by YaCy**

**Key Features:**

*   **Web Search Integration:**  Enables your LLMs to access and process information from the web in real-time, going beyond their static training data.
*   **YaCy Powered:** Utilizes YaCy, a free, open-source, and decentralized search engine network, offering a privacy-respecting alternative to mainstream search engines.
*   **Enhanced LLM Responses:**  LLMs can provide more informed, up-to-date, and contextually accurate answers by incorporating web search results.
*   **Clean Content Extraction:**  Intelligently extracts relevant text content from web pages, minimizing noise and maximizing efficiency for LLM processing (HTML junk is removed!).
*   **Easy Installation:** Designed for simple integration into your existing OpenWebUI instance.

**What is YaCy?**

YaCy is a free distributed search engine, built on principles of decentralization and user privacy.  It operates as a peer-to-peer network where each YaCy instance contributes to indexing and searching the web. This makes it a compelling option for those seeking an alternative to centralized search engines.

This extension is ideal for OpenWebUI users who:

*   Want to give their LLMs access to real-time web information.
*   Are interested in using decentralized and privacy-focused technologies like YaCy.
